"Don't miss this common mistake—if you're not doing this, you're losing respect. When leading, always prioritize clear communication. For example, instead of saying, 'I’ll handle it,' delegate tasks with specifics like, 'Alex, can you draft the report by Friday?' This builds trust and accountability. And here's a tip for handling conflict: ask one question, then pause. For instance, 'How can we resolve this together?' Silence shows confidence and invites collaboration. Small changes like these can transform your leadership presence."
